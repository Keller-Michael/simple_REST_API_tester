# ðŸ§ª Simple REST API tester
 
This is a very simple [class](/src/zcl_simple_rest_api_tester.clas.abap) to test REST API while prototyping a bigger application. It is not intended for productive use because it violates all the rules of object-oriented design (public attributes that should be private, no single responsibility principle and more is missing here). But you can quickly implement and modify this class to perform a test with a REST API.
